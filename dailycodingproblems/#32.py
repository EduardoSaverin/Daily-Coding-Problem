    Problem 32

    Suppose you are given a table of currency exchange rates, represented as a 2D array. 
    Determine whether there is a possible arbitrage: that is, whether there is some sequence of trades you can make, 
    starting with some amount A of any currency, so that you can end up with some amount greater than A of that currency.
